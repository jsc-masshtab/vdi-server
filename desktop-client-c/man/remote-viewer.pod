=head1 NAME

remote-viewer - a simple remote desktop client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<remote-viewer> [OPTIONS] -- [URI]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<remote-viewer> is a simple remote display client. The supported
protocols are SPICE and VNC.

Starting remote-viewer without URI will open a simple dialog with an
entry and a list of previously successfully accessed URI.

The URI can also point to a connection settings file, see the CONNECTION FILE
section for a description of the format.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following options are accepted when running C<remote-viewer>:

=over 4

=item -h, --help

Display command line help summary

=item -V, --version

Display program version number

=item -v, --verbose

Display information about the connection

=item -z PCT, --zoom=PCT

Zoom level of the display window in percentage. Range 10-400.

=item -f, --full-screen

Start with the windows maximized to fullscreen.

If supported, the remote display will be reconfigured to match the physical
client monitor configuration, by enabling or disabling extra monitors as
necessary. This is currently implemented by the Spice backend only.

To specify which client monitors are used in fullscreen mode, see the
CONFIGURATION section below.

=item -t TITLE, --title TITLE

Set the window title to B<TITLE>

=item --spice-controller

Use the SPICE controller to initialize the connection with the SPICE
server. This option is used by the SPICE browser addons to allow web
page to start a client.

=item --debug

Print debugging information

=item -H HOTKEYS, --hotkeys HOTKEYS

Set global hotkey bindings. By default, keyboard shortcuts only work when the
guest display widget does not have focus.  Any actions specified in B<HOTKEYS>
will be effective even when the guest display widget has input focus. The format
for B<HOTKEYS> is <action1>=<key1>[+<key2>][,<action2>=<key3>[+<key4>]].
Key-names are case-insensitive. Valid actions are: toggle-fullscreen,
release-cursor, secure-attention, smartcard-insert and smartcard-remove.  The
C<secure-attention> action sends a secure attention sequence (Ctrl+Alt+Del) to
the guest. Examples:

  --hotkeys=toggle-fullscreen=shift+f11,release-cursor=shift+f12

  --hotkeys=release-cursor=ctrl+alt

Note that hotkeys for which no binding is given are disabled. Although the
hotkeys specified here are handled by the client, it is still possible to send
these key combinations to the guest via a menu item.

=item -k, --kiosk

Start in kiosk mode. In this mode, the application will start in
fullscreen with minimal UI. It will prevent the user from quitting or
performing any interaction outside of usage of the remote desktop
session.

Note that it can't offer a complete secure solution by itself. Your
kiosk system must have additional configuration and security settings
to lock down the OS. In particular, you must configure or disable the
window manager, limit the session capabilities, use some
restart/watchdog mechanism, disable VT switching etc.

=item --kiosk-quit <never|on-disconnect>

By default, when kiosk mode is enabled, virt-viewer will remain open
when the connection to the remote server is terminated. By setting
kiosk-quit option to "on-disconnect" value, virt-viewer will quit
instead.

=back

=head1 HOTKEY

A key binding combination is described by a series of key strings
separated by '+' that must be pressed together in order to activate
the associated action.

It must be composed of modifiers (shift, ctrl or alt) and a
non-modifier key. For example, "shift+f11".

=head1 CONNECTION FILE

B<remote-viewer> connection file is of INI file format, with a
mandatory [virt-viewer] group and "type" key.

=head2 Example

Opening a file with the following content will start remote-viewer in
fullscreen and connect to the host "betsiboka" using the SPICE
protocol:

 [virt-viewer]
 type=spice
 host=betsiboka
 port=5900
 fullscreen=1

=head2 Key list

=over 4

=item C<version> (string)

If remote-viewer version number isn't greater or equal to the required
version, an error is raised with the expected version.

The version format accepted is a list of integers separated by '.'. It can
be followed by a dash '-' and an additional build number with the same format.

Version comparison is done by comparing each integer from the list one by
one. If any of the component is not a number, the version comparison will fail
and consider that the 2 versions are considered to be the same.

=item C<versions> (osid:version list)

This is a list of osid:version couples separated by ';'. osid is an arbitrary string, version is
a version number in the same format as in the 'version' field. A given couple indicates that
remote-viewer builds matching the given 'osid' (fedora22, debian7, ...) must
be at least version 'version'. For consistency, it's recommended to use libosinfo OS shortids as
the osid.

=item C<newer-version-url> (string)

If specified, this field is an URL which will be displayed to the user when a version check
fails.

=item C<type> (string, mandatory)

The session type, either "spice", "vnc" or "ovirt".

=item C<host> (string, mandatory)

The server host to connect to.

=item C<port> (integer)

The server port to connect to.

=item C<tls-port> (integer)

The server TLS/SSL port to connect to.

=item C<username> (string)

The username for the session authentication.

=item C<password> (string)

The password for the session authentication.

=item C<disable-channels> (string list)

The list of session channels to disable.

The current SPICE channels are: main, display, inputs, cursor, playback, record, smartcard, usbredir.

=item C<tls-ciphers> (string)

OpenSSL cipher list format. (see ciphers(1))

=item C<title> (string)

String to present in the window title.

=item C<fullscreen> (boolean)

Opens the client windows in fullscreen.

=item C<ca> (string)

CA certificate in PEM format (using "\n" to separate the lines). This will be
used to verify the SSL certificate used for SPICE TLS sessions.

=item C<host-subject> (string)

Verify the certificate subject matches with the given subject.

=item C<toggle-fullscreen> (hotkey string)

Key binding for entering and leaving fullscreen mode. (see L<HOTKEY> for description of expected string)

=item C<release-cursor> (hotkey string)

Key binding for releasing cursor grab. (see L<HOTKEY> for description of expected string)

=item C<smartcard-insert> (hotkey string)

Key binding for inserting emulated smartcard. (see L<HOTKEY> for description of expected string)

=item C<smartcard-remove> (hotkey string)

Key binding for removing emulated smartcard. (see L<HOTKEY> for description of expected string)

=item C<color-depth> (integer)

Set the color depth of the guest display (16 or 32).

=item C<disable-effects> (string list)

A list of desktop effects to disable in the remote guest.

The effects that can be disabled with SPICE are: wallpaper,
font-smooth, animation or all.

=item C<enable-smartcard> (boolean)

=item C<enable-usb-autoshare> (boolean)

Set to 1 to enable client USB devices auto-sharing.

=item C<usb-filter> (string)

Set a string specifying a filter to use to determine which USB devices
to autoconnect when plugged in, a filter consists of one or more
rules. Where each rule has the form of:

C<class,vendor,product,version,allow>

Use -1 for class/vendor/product/version to accept any value.

And the rules themselves are concatenated like this:

C<rule1|rule2|rule3>

=item C<secure-channels> (string list)

The list of session channels to secure.

The current SPICE channels are: main, display, inputs, cursor, playback, record, smartcard, usbredir.

=item C<delete-this-file> (boolean)

Set to 1 for the client to remove this connection file (if it can't, it will fail silently)

=item C<proxy> (string)

A proxy URL to tunnel the connection through.

At the time of writing this documentation, the only supported proxy
method with Spice is HTTP CONNECT.

For example, to tunnel connection through foobar host HTTP proxy on
port 8080, use the value "http://foobar:8080".

=back

=head2 oVirt Support

The connection file can also carry some oVirt-specific options when oVirt
support is compiled in. These options are used to interact with oVirt REST API.
This is currently only used in order to show a menu allowing to change the CD
image being used by the virtual machine from remote-viewer user interface.
These options go in an optional [ovirt] group.

=over 4

=item C<host> (string, mandatory)

The oVirt instance to connect to. This corresponds to the hostname one would
connect to access the oVirt user or admin portal.

=item C<vm-guid> (string, mandatory)

GUID of the oVirt virtual machine to connect to.

=item C<jsessionid> (string)

Value to set the 'jsessionid' cookie to. With oVirt 3.6, setting this
authentication cookie to a valid value will allow to interact with the oVirt
REST API without being asked for credentials.

=item C<sso-token> (string)

Value to set the 'Authorization' header to. With oVirt 4.0 or newer, setting
this authentication header to a valid value will allow to interact with the
oVirt REST API without being asked for credentials.

=item C<ca> (string)

CA certificate in PEM format (using "\n" to separate the lines). This will be used to validate
the certificate used for the oVirt REST https session remote-viewer will establish.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

A small number of configuration options can be controlled by editing the
settings file located in the user configuration directory:

    <USER-CONFIG-DIR>/virt-viewer/settings

This file is a text file in INI format, with application options in the
[virt-viewer] group and per-guest options in a group identified by the guest's
UUID. The application options should not be edited manually. There is also a
special [fallback] group which specifies options for all guests that don't have
an explicit group.

For each guest, the initial fullscreen monitor configuration can be specified
by using the B<monitor-mapping> key. This configuration only takes effect when
the -f/--full-screen option is specified.

The value of this key is a list of mappings between a guest display and a
client monitor. Each mapping is separated by a semicolon character, and the
mappings have the format <GUEST-DISPLAY-ID>:<CLIENT-MONITOR-ID>.

For example, to map guest displays 1 and 2 to client monitors 2 and 3 for the
guest with a UUID of e4591275-d9d3-4a44-a18b-ef2fbc8ac3e2, use:

    [e4591275-d9d3-4a44-a18b-ef2fbc8ac3e2]
    monitor-mapping=1:2;2:3

The monitor-mapping must contain ids of all displays from 1 to the last
desired display id, e.g. "monitor-mapping=3:3" is invalid because mappings
for displays 1 and 2 are not specified.

=head1 EXAMPLES
