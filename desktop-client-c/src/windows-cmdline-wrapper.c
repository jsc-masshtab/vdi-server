 *
 * Usage:
 * If your app is a GUI app compiled with -Wl,--subsystem,windows But
 * you still want to run it from the command line to support console
 * interaction (input, output), you can compile and install this small
 * wrapper as a .com file next to your .exe. (.com takes precedence)
 *
 * This wrapper will call the .exe with the same arguments, and wait
 * until it finished. The child process should attach to the same
 * console and redirect standard input/output, this way:
 *
 *   if (AttachConsole(ATTACH_PARENT_PROCESS) != 0) {
 *       freopen("CONIN$", "r", stdin);
 *       freopen("CONOUT$", "w", stdout);
 *       freopen("CONOUT$", "w", stderr);
 *       dup2(fileno(stdin), STDIN_FILENO);
 *       dup2(fileno(stdout), STDOUT_FILENO);
 *       dup2(fileno(stderr), STDERR_FILENO);
 *   }

 * Note: if you have a better solution for hybrid console/windows app,
 * I would be glad to learn how!
